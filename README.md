<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](src/photos/product-screenshot.jpg)

The project involved creating a website for a foundation that helps children in need.

The first step in the project was to talk about general conception. Based on these discussions, a plan was developed for the website design, content, and functionality.

The design phase of the project involved creating a mockup of the website's layout and visual elements. We wanted a bright, cheerful design that would appeal to children and families, while still conveying a sense of professionalism and trustworthiness. Once that was done, the website's content was developed.

Overall, we made a professional, user-friendly website.
